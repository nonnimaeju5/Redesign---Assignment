## For this assignment i decided to do a tutorial through Flux Academy, i am a total beginner in Figma,
so i decided it would be better for me to do this beginner friendly tutorial, rather than trying to redesign a site with no Figma experience.

## Let the design breath: I tryed to use plenty of whitespace to give it some breathingspace. Modern, simple and easy to navigate is something you 
have to have in the back of your mind when designing.

## Alignment: In the tutorial they show us the layout grid with wide columns and add some to gutter, that made the positioning much simpler.
But centered was mainly used. 

## Contrast in elements and color: Nothing complicated about the text just made it all white. I think the white color is easily readable regarding to contrast.

## Color pallette: My color pallette is basically the same as in the tutorial, i changed the background to a little lighter purple. Color picker was used for the rest. 

## Scale/Visual hierarchy: Visual Hierarchy is used to show the user to what are the important sections. The headers are bigger and the font is bold. The H2 is semi -bold and text is light.

## Use of typography: I used mainly Outfit for everything except Roboto for small text.
